# Photopea Offline

## Why I made this
The creator of [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), a great free alternative to Photoshop, is not interested on making an offline version, so I took it upon myself to make it.

## Issues
If there are any issues, please let me know. I tried to get fonts working the best I could, but there is very little documentation, so I had to work with an outdated list. If there are any fonts missing, let me know, and I will add them in individually. 

## How to use
1. Download the repository
1. Open a terminal
1. `cd` into the folder where you downloaded it
1. In the folder, type *exactly* this: `python -m http.server --directory www.photopea.com 8887`
1. Open [http://localhost:8887](http://localhost:8887). It should load and you can use it like normal.
